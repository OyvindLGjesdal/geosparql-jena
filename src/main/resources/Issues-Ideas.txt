Issues
- axis order when parsing and unparsing.
- check unit of measure.
- topological filter functions required?
- query rewrite in property functions correct?
- CRS conversion between geometries correct? Particularly custom defined CRS84.
- Compliance Tests.

Custom Function Ideas
- Geodatic distance: function available in GeoTools under JTS wrapper.
- Shortest path: along touching linestrings and defined nodes/edges.
