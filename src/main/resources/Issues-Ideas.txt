Issues
- axis order when parsing and unparsing.
- check unit of measure.
- topological filter functions required?
- sfOverlaps correct in JTS? Or fault in geosparqlSample.rdf?
- CRS conversion between geometries correct? Particularly custom defined CRS84.
- Compliance Tests - structure but need tests. Repetition of loading.
- Project Documents - implementation challenges and draft paper.

Custom Function Ideas
- Geodatic distance: function available in GeoTools under JTS wrapper.
- Shortest path: along touching linestrings and defined nodes/edges.
